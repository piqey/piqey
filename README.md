# About

I'm a multidisciplinary digital artist specializing in programming, level design, environment art, and sound engineering.

My journey began at 12 when I first dabbled in codeâ€”by 18, I moved beyond following tutorials and began architecting my own systems.

Over the years, I developed an intuitive grasp of new tools and workflows, using fundamental principles I honed through trial and error to build robust solutions from the ground up.

My earliest forays into mapping with Valve's Source Engine resurfaced in 2018â€“2019, but it wasn't until the release of _Half-Life: Alyx_'s modding toolsâ€”and later exploring similar pursuits in _s&box_â€”that everything clicked. This experience solidified my passion for immersive world-building and refined my approach to environment art.

Drawing from these experiences, I leverage my programming expertise to inform my design choices, blending technical logic with creative vision.

## The Page

Unfortunately, _most_ of my work is private or otherwise unsharable, so the list of works below will be short. If you want to see more visual content, please see the **YouTube Playlists** section below, or visit my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/piqey/).

I have, however, made a number of minor contributions to other public repositories in the form **Pull Requests** and **Issues**. Assuming GitHub's profile page layout hasn't been updated as of my writing, you ought to be able to see a timeline of any public contributions I've made by scrolling down below.

# Past Affiliations

## [Eagle One](https://eagleone.dev/) â€¢ Game Programmer

I was a programmer with Eagle One, a group of developers making content for _Half-Life: Alyx_ and _s&box_. At the time I was most active in the group, we were working on a **symmetrical multiplayer game** which still has **not been released**, where I was responsible for creating several systems pertaining to multiplayer play.

## Programming

- ### [gmsv_visinfo](https://github.com/piqey/gmsv_visinfo)
  - A binary module for _Garry's Mod_ that provides an intuitive interface for the game's Lua API to interact with the Source engine's [visibility-related engine functions](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/PVS) (via direct function calls).

  - A classic _Garry's Mod_ map created for the popular gamemode _Zombie Survival_ that I **remastered** with HDR lighting, new textures (including normal maps and self-shadowed bump maps), new specular lighting, original sound effects, etc., that I all personally made.

  - **2nd Place ðŸ¥ˆ prize-winning submission** for the very first _Half-Life: Alyx_ mapping competition.
  - At the time this competition began, _Half-Life: Alyx_'s modding tools had only been released for about two weeks, and the competition was scheduled to run for just under a month (June 7th â€“ July 5th, 2020). I had even less time to complete mine as I was leaving on a family vacation about a week and a half before the contest concluded, so I had to hand it off to a friend before it was complete so that he could give the very end of the level the finishing touches that were needed and create an abrupt but passable ending to the level, making it an acceptable submission for the contest.
    - [Another person's recorded plathrough](https://youtu.be/l70LEIj-2Ms) (chance encounter of mine on YouTube)
    - [My recorded playthrough (early build)](https://youtu.be/goM9iE0AWg4)
  - If I were to make a similar level nowadays, I would do so much different. The level ended up as it did because of the time constraint and the fact that nobody knew anything about the tools we'd by that point had access to for only two weeks. Following _Dirty Deeds_, I went on to make much better solo content, but unfortunately nothing I ever released.
